# Breach Checker Application

This project was developed by a team of four during the **CyberHack**, a contest organized by our faculty in partnership with **InnovationLabs**. This was our first collaborative project, created within a tight 24-hour timeframe. The main objective was to build a functional and user-friendly tool to manage and secure email accounts by checking for potential breaches and generating secure passwords.

## üí° Challenges We Faced
This project was a significant learning experience for all of us. Some of the challenges we encountered included:
1. **First Team Project**: Collaborating as a team of four on a software project was entirely new to us. Coordinating effectively and merging our work required careful planning.
2. **Beginner-Level Python Knowledge**: While we were familiar with Python, we were all still learning. Implementing features like breach detection, JSON file management, and GUI design pushed us out of our comfort zones.
3. **Time Constraint**: Completing the entire project within 24 hours during the CyberHack contest was both thrilling and challenging.
